// Package inbox is a consumer's guard against handling a redelivered event
// twice, on any SQL engine that supplies its statement.
//
// Delivery is at least once, so a handler can see an event again. An
// [Inbox] is built with [New] over an [Engine], the statement one engine's
// module compiles. One such module is messaging/postgres, which ships the
// inbox's table in the same migration set as the outbox's. [Inbox.Claim]
// records, in the handler's own transaction, that a consumer is handling an
// event, and reports whether it is the first time. The claim commits with
// the handler's work or rolls back with it, so when a handler fails, its
// redelivery can claim the event again. This package holds no SQL and
// imports no driver.

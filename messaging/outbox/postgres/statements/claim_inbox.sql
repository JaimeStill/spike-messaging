--| native: INSERT ... ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING, so a repeated claim changes no row instead of failing the handler's transaction. Port: an engine must insert or skip in one statement (SQLite has ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING; MySQL has INSERT IGNORE; SQL Server and Oracle have MERGE).
-- Records that a consumer handled an event, in the handler's own
-- transaction. One row affected is the first claim. As with emit.sql, the
-- transaction requirement is event.Tx's, so the file does not declare it.
INSERT INTO messaging_inbox (consumer, source, id)
VALUES ({{consumer}}, {{source}}, {{id}})
ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING

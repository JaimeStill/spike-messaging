// the parameters named here. [New] checks both. Emit runs on the command's
// transaction, a sqlate *Tx, so it may declare a transaction required.

	// takes no parameters and returns seq, header, and data, in that order,
	// or no row. A statement exposes no result columns, so [New] cannot
	// check them; a mismatch fails the relay's first claim.
